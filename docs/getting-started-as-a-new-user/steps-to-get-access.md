# Setting up a profile

When first set up, users will get an email from Google (to their normal email address). This will have a username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk username. You need to Add this as a Profile in Google Chrome. Please do not try to use any other browser than Google Chrome\!  
!!! note
    This username is not an email address, and we will not send email to it. It cannot receive email; it is just a username for the TRE.  Once you have done this, go to Manage Your Account and Security and turn 2 Step Verification on. You will need to enter a phone number and get a code by SMS/text message. You cannot access the TRE without this enabled.
